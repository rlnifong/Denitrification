\description{
Creates a list of data objects to be used by stan
}
\details{
Model determines which model to estimate. 0 is the oxygen model (Eq. 2 from Nifong et al), 1 is the single station model without N consumption (DN base model; Eq. 3 from Nifong et al.), 2 is the single station model with N consumption (DN + Nconsume; Eq. 4 from Nifong et al.), the  3 being the two-station model without N consumption (DN base; Eq. 5 from Nifong et al.), and 4 being the two station model with N consumption (DN N consume; Eq. 6 from Nifong et al.).
